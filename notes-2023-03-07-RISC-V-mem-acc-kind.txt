Trying to understand how RISC-V memory access annotations flow into RMEM.

See sail-riscv/model/riscv_analysis.sail for the memory access annotations
currently used by RISC-V (new-Sail). Those are then mapped in
rmem/src_isa_defs/sail_1_2_convert.lem to old-Sail. And those are
lifted in rmem/src_concurrency_model/instructionKindPredicates.lem to
architecture specific predicates.

Examples:
ASM       | man model                | new-Sail                    | mapped to old-Sail
LR.D      | reserved                 | Read_RISCV_reserved         | Read_RISCV_reserved
LR.D.aq   | reserved + acquire-RCsc  | Read_RISCV_reserved_acquire | Read_RISCV_reserved_acquire_RCsc
LR.D.aqrl | reserved + acquire-RCsc..| Read_RISCV_reserved_strong..| Read_RISCV_reserved_acquire_release
                   ..+ release-RCsc  | .._acquire                  |
LR.D.rl --- invalid ---

ASM       | man model                   | new-Sail                        | mapped to old-Sail
SC.D      | conditional                 | Write_RISCV_conditional         | Write_RISCV_conditional
SC.D.rl   | conditional + release-RCsc  | Write_RISCV_conditional_release | Write_RISCV_conditional_release_RCsc
SC.D.aqrl | conditional + acquire-RCsc..| Write_RISCV_conditional_strong..| Write_RISCV_conditional_acquire_release
                      ..+ release-RCsc  | .._release
SC.D.aq --- invalid ---

ASM           | man model 'read, write' (new/old-Sail as above)
AMOADD.D      | reserved, conditional
AMOADD.D.aq   | reserved acquire-RCsc, conditional
AMOADD.D.rl   | reserved, conditional + release-RCsc
AMOADD.D.aqrl | reserved acquire-RCsc + release-RCsc, conditional + acquire-RCsc + release-RCsc

The important rules from the RV manual mem-model:
5. a has an acquire annotation;
6. b has a release annotation;
7. a and b both have RCsc annotations;
Current RV non-Ztso ISA doesn't use RCpc at all.
Future encodings might include:
load + acquire-RCpc
load + acquire-RCsc
load + acquire-RCsc + release-RCsc
store + release-RCpc
store + release-RCsc
store + acquire-RCsc + release-RCsc
and similarly RCpc variants for LR, SC, and AMOs.
